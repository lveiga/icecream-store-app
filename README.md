# icecream-store-app

## This is just a IT test for some company

Part 1 - Create a REST endpoint that saves orders coming from POS.
The POS will be sending the following information: store number, order number, order date time, flavours, toppings, amount of ice and the total order price.
 
2 - The backend service must expose an endpoint that returns the total numbers of orders and sum of the order price aggregated by store for a given month.
